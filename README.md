This extension displays a table of contents on top of the page content automatically. It detects the presence of heading
elements in the page content to form the table of contents. If you just need the jump link feature without a table of
contents, you might be more interested in the [Anchor](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.anchor) extension.
